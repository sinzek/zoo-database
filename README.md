# Zoo Database Project (Team 10)

Our frontend's development server uses Vite. Learn more about it here:
https://vite.dev/guide/

We're also using react to add 'reactivity' and 'componentization' to our website. Read about those here:

Four our backend, we'll be using Node.js. It's a rabbit hole, so here's a quick guide:

## Get started

Install NodeJS to your system: https://nodejs.org/en/download

After cloning this repo, run `npm install` in the project root (npm is the Node Package Manager).

To spin up a dev server to view our frontend, run `npm run dev` when in the /frontend folder.
