## Learn

We'll be using Vite for a frontend dev server. Learn more about it here:
<https://vite.dev/guide/>

We're also using react to add 'reactivity' and 'componentization' to our website. Read about those here:
<https://react.dev/learn>

For our backend, we'll be using Node.js. It's a rabbit hole, so here's a quick guide:

## Get started

Install NodeJS to your system: <https://nodejs.org/en/download>

After cloning this repo, run `npm install` in the /main folder (npm is the Node Package Manager).

To spin up a dev server to view our frontend, run `npm run dev` when in the /main folder.

To start the NodeJS server for our backend, run `node api/index.js` when in the /backend folder.

## Commit naming conventions

feat for features, fix for bugfixes, chore for everything else

Example:
`feat: created navbar component for frontend pages`
